###Variables and Constants
#####***let vs const:***
let - you can reassign (normal assignment operation) this variable
const - cannot reassign the variable, can only do so using methods and such

###Data Types
#####***Primitive Types***
String - sequence of characters, must be enclosed in quotes (single or double) or backticks
Number - integers, as well as floating-point numbers
Boolean - logical entity: true or false
Null - intentional absence of any object value
Undefined - a variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
Symbol - built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
BigInt - numbers that are greater than the 'Number' type can handle
#####***Reference Types (Objects)***
Non-primitive value and when assigned to a variable, the variable is given a reference to that value
Object literals, arrays and functions are all reference types

#####***Strings***
Template Literals - call variable values (or any js code) in strings without concatenation
have to use backticks instead of quotes and then dollar sign and squiggly brackets
ex. let phrase = `Hello my name is ${firstName}`
